# LeetCode Problem 1: Two Sum (Easy)

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

### Constraints
- Each input is guaranteed to have **exactly one solution**.  
- You **cannot use the same element twice**.  
- The answer can be returned in **any order**.  

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
