# LeetCode Problem 108: Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in **ascending order**.  
Convert it into a **height-balanced binary search tree (BST)**.

A height-balanced BST is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.
